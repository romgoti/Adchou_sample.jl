This package reproduces some of the results in Adchou et al. (2022) [![Link](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-stable-blue.svg)](https://benjaminmoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/HACT.pdf) : Income and Wealth Distribution in Macroeconomics: A Continuous-Time Approach

It was prepared for the course Computational Econ [![Link](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-stable-blue.svg)](https://floswald.github.io/NumericalMethods/) by Florian Oswald. I translate Matlab code from codes from Ben Moll's website [![Link](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-stable-blue.svg)]([https://benjaminmoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/HACT.pdf](https://benjaminmoll.com/codes/))

I reproduce figures 7 and 10.

Figure 7 : Consumption + saving policy functions and stationary distribution of wealth in a 2-states Aiyagari model

Figure 10 : Consumption + saving + housing policy functions and stationary distribution of wealth for different scenarii in a 2-states non-convex Aiyagari model with a housing good
